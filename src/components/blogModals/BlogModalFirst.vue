                            There are 4 general categories of biohazardous wastes based on the physical form of the waste. 
                            Each form must be segregated, identified, decontaminated and disposed of in an appropriate manner 
                            in order to minimize occupational exposure and environmental release risks.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Solid biohazardous waste(non-sharps)</h5>
                        <p>
                            - This includes any non-sharp item that is contaminated with human or animal diagnostic specimen material 
                            (i.e., body fluids, tissue debris), any microbiological culture material (including recombinant DNA).

                            - Biohazardous / biomedical waste refers to any material having the risk of carrying pathogens which can
                            potentially harm humans.
                            <br>
                            The biohazardous wastes generated at Concordia University include: 	
                            <br>    •	Human and animal blood and blood products
                            <br>    •	Cultures and stocks of etiologic agents and associated biologicals
                            <br>    •	Laboratory waste that has come in contact with a biohazard
                            <br>    •	Sharps that have been in contact with biological materials
                            <br>    •	Animal waste, animal carcasses and body parts

                        <h5>Sharps</h5>
                        <p>
                            - Sharps are medical devices with sharp points or edges that can puncture or cut the skin. 
                            Examples include needles, syringes and lancets. Sharps are used by a diverse range of community 
                            members including people with diabetes and other medical conditions, pet owners and people who use 
                            illicit substances.

                            of used sharps supports public health and safety. Trauma cleaning companies and healthcare workers have 
                            the equipment and safety training to properly deal with sharps.

                        <p>
                            - Pathological waste consists of recognizable human derived tissues, organs, and body parts, as well as
                            vertebrate animal-derived tissues, organs, and body parts. Pathological wastes must be disposed of by
                            interment or incineration.

                        <h5>Protecting yourself from biohazardous waste</h5>  
                        <p>
                            
                            You can take several precautions to protect yourself from biohazards. Some of these include:
                            <br>    •	Treating each situation as potentially dangerous. Don’t ever assume a situation involving biohazards
                                        will be fine to respond to without proper precautions.
                            <br>    •	Washing your hands frequently with warm water and soap.
                            <br>    •	Wearing <a href="https://www.osha.gov/personal-protective-equipment"

                                when responding to situations involving biohazards. These can include gloves, facemasks and shields,
                                respirators, aprons, special protective eyewear, and full body gowns or suits.
                            <br>    •	Utilizing proper disposal methods including labeled biohazard bags or containers.

                                        •	Immediately contacting professionals who can properly dispose of biohazards. Such as trauma 
                                cleaning services.</a>

                        <h5>Who deals with biohazardous waste?</h5>
                        <p>  
                            Individuals working in the medical field are faced with biohazards on a daily basis. Used syringes, 
                            specimen cultures, discarded surgical gloves, and sharps are all biohazardous materials that are common 
                            in hospitals and medical offices and require special care during disposal. However, doctors, nurses, 
                            and lab technicians are not the only ones at risk. People working in trauma care and trauma cleaning, 
                            law enforcement, coroners, medical examiners, property management, veterinary medicine, waste management, 
                            manufacturing, agriculture, and other professions are also at a high risk for workplace biohazards, along 
                            with any worker who has been exposed to the scene of an accident.
