                            their workers are always protected against potential risk. This all depends on the 
                            industry they are working in. For instance, if you are a carpenter working on a 
                            construction site, your PPE might include a hard hat, steel toed boots, safety 
                            glasses, and a high vis vest. Where a

                             would wear PPE such as latex

                            (PPE) is a worker's last defense against injury and death, when eliminating 
                            workplace hazards is not possible. To make sure this equipment protects workers

                            Though PPE is usually mandatory and enforced by most employers, it is very important
                             that the worker protects themselves in hazardous situations. Always assess the job 
                             or situation you are going into before conducting any work. For instance, if you came
                            across a 
                            <a href="https://mnrsolutions.ca/#/services" 
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trauma scene</a>
                             that needed to be cleaned, whether it be a family member or 
                            friend's house, you must assess the job before conducting any work. If there are
                            <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000453.htm" 
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bloodborne pathogens</a>
                             at the trauma scene, you could be at risk to 
                            <a href="http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/disease-types/bloodborne-diseases" 
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bloodborne diseases</a>
                             
                            and should call a trained professional to deal with the trauma scene cleaning. Or 
                            if there are 
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_feces" 
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">human feces</a>
                             at the trauma scene, this is a biohazard and could also 
                            contain diseases such as C.Diff, Hepatitis A and E, Giardia, E coli, Cholera, and 
                            Norovirus. Again it is important to call trained professionals so that they can 
                            properly conduct 
                            <a href="https://mnrsolutions.ca/#/"

                             and dispose of any risks at the trauma scene.
