  <blockquote>
  <p>"We were able to end the tenancy of a tenant with severe hoarding tendencies. After two unsuccessful attempts to end the tenancy through the Residential Tenancy Office’s dispute resolution hearing, we contracted CTI Services to inspect the premises and report on their findings to aid in our evidence submission for our third hearing.”</p>

  <p><strong><a href="https://vancouver.ca/people-programs/hoarding-action-response-team.aspx">19. The Hoarding Action Response Team</a> (HART)</strong> is a partnership between the City and Vancouver Coastal Health — provides a coordinated community response to those impacted by hoarding. Compulsive hoarding is a serious public health hazard that poses significant health and safety risks for individuals, families, and communities.</p>
  <p>The team's role is to provide healthy and safe outcomes for people affected by hoarding, and ensure people with hoarding issues receive appropriate health care support quickly.</p>
  <p>You can use Vancouver's hoarding assessment tool&nbsp; to see how serious your hoard is. <a href="https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/hoarding-clutter-image-rating-scale.pdf">Clutter Rating Guide PDF download here.</a></p>
  <p><strong>20. Tenant Resource &amp; Advisory Centre</strong> can help you work out the legal implications of hoarding in your dwelling. BC tenants and landlords should be familiar with the Residential Tenancy Branch (RTB) – the department of the provincial government in charge of residential tenancy law. The RTB runs an administrative tribunal that can rule on or “adjudicate” legal disputes between tenants and landlords.</p>
  <p>This service – known as “dispute resolution” – is similar to court in some respects, but offers a more affordable and accessible adjudication process. For example, the standard application fee is only $100, and most hearings are conducted over the phone with an&nbsp;<span class="definition">arbitrator</span>, rather than a judge. <a href="https://tenants.bc.ca/resources/">When tenants and landlords cannot resolve legal disputes on their own</a>, the solution is rarely to hire a lawyer and go to court. The vast majority of rental disputes in BC must be adjudicated through the RTB’s dispute resolution process.</p>
