                            Though most of us never dream of discovering someone that has passed away, it is something 
                            that many people go through on a daily basis. In this post, we will cover a step by step in
                             what needs to be done and the importance of every action taken when coming across a 
                             <a href="https://mnrsolutions.ca/#/" 
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trauma Scene.</a>
                        </p>

                        <h5>Keep a distance</h5>
                        <p>
                            The first action to take when coming across a trauma scene is to make sure you do not touch
                             anything. Bodies can start 
                             <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/risks-posed-by-dead-bodies-after-disasters" 
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decomposing</a> 
                             quite quickly which can be very harmful. Make sure 
                             you keep a distance when observing the trauma scene. The trauma scene may also need to be 
                             investigated by the police. If anything has been touched or tampered with, this can 
                             interfere with a potential investigation.

                        </p>

                        
                        <h5>Call the authorities</h5>
                        <p>
                            The second action to take is to call the authorities. They will want to confirm that the 
                            person is no longer alive so you can expect them to ask you to feel the body to see if it 
                            is cold or not; only do this if it is safe. Make sure to follow all instructions given by 
                            the 911 operator. Once they have determined the situation, you will have to wait nearby
                             the trauma scene until the police or paramedics arrive. Again, it is important to keep 
                             a safe distance from the trauma scene to prevent yourself from being at

                             It is encouraged to wait outside the front door to ensure the next person to enter is
                              a profession that deals with trauma scenes.

                        <h5>Cooperate with the professionals</h5>
                        <p>
                            The third step when discovering a trauma scene is to cooperate with the authorities.
                             Answer questions and give as much information as possible to help them with any 
                             investigation or to better understand what happened.

                        <h5>Call a trauma scene cleaning professional</h5>
                        <p>
                            It is very important not to try and clean 
                            <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/waste-management/hazardous-waste" 
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bio-hazardous waste</a> on your own. There are 
                            many steps taken when cleaning a trauma scene to ensure the safety of everyone involved.
                             In most cases, the body has left behind a mess that needs to be professionally cleaned
                              by a 
                              <a href="https://mnrsolutions.ca/#/" 
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trauma cleaning professional.</a> This can also involve the disposal of contaminated 
                              items in the unit such as beds, furniture, carpets, and rugs. These items will be 
                              deemed as a biohazard and need to be properly handled and disposed of to prevent anyone
                               from getting ill. Trauma scenes can also have a certain smell in the air that needs
                                to be properly neutralized.
